              <h2>History</h2>
              <p>
              The Spot robot took inspiration from Cheetahs and Dogs. It was designed for military and logistics applications. Spot made its debut in 2015 as a smaller and more agile version. In 2016, Boston Dynamics released the Spot Research Edition for researchers and developers. Over the years, Spot underwent continuous improvements in mobility and autonomy. In 2020, it became commercially available, opening doors for industries like construction and oil and gas. Spot's versatility, dynamic movements, and ability to operate autonomously or under remote control have made it valuable for inspections and data collection. Boston Dynamics actively seeks user feedback to refine Spot's capabilities, ensuring its ongoing evolution and adoption in various industries.

              <h2>Potenial Threat</h2>
              <p>Potential Threat
                The Spot robot, with its advanced mobility, autonomous capabilities, and adaptability, could potentially pose a threat if deployed for malicious purposes. As a versatile robotic platform capable of navigating diverse environments, Spot might be utilized to carry out tasks ranging from surveillance to data collection. If integrated into a networked system with the ability to communicate and coordinate, a large fleet of Spot robots could potentially be weaponized or used to compromise security. The threat would lie in the combination of Spot's physical capabilities and the potential for centralized control, allowing for coordinated actions that might challenge human safety and control. With regards to the threat it poses, we need to understand its weaknesses and hopefully disable it before it "disables" us.</p>
